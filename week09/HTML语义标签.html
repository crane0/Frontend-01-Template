        <p>Tim Berners-Lee's vision of a global hyperlinked information system became a possibility by the second half of the
        1980s.[8] By 1985, the global Internet began to proliferate in Europe and the Domain Name System (upon which the Uniform
        Resource Locator is built) came into being. In 1988 the first direct IP connection between Europe and North America was
        made and Berners-Lee began to openly discuss the possibility of a web-like system at CERN.[9] In March 1989 Berners-Lee
        issued a proposal to the management at CERN for a system called "Mesh" that referenced ENQUIRE, a database and software
        project he had built in 1980, which used the term "web" and described a more elaborate information management system
        based on links embedded in readable text: "Imagine, then, the references in this document all being associated with the
        network address of the thing to which they referred, so that while reading this document you could skip to them with a
        click of the mouse." Such a system, he explained, could be referred to using one of the existing meanings of the word
        hypertext, a term that he says was coined in the 1950s. There is no reason, the proposal continues, why such hypertext
        links could not encompass multimedia documents including graphics, speech and video, so that Berners-Lee goes on to use
        the term hypermedia.[10]</p>

        <p>The terms Internet and World Wide Web are often used without much distinction. However, the two are not the same. 
        <dfn>The Internet</dfn> is a global system of interconnected computer networks. In contrast, <dfn>the World Wide Web</dfn> is a global collection
        of documents and other resources, linked by hyperlinks and URIs. Web resources are accessed using HTTP or HTTPS, which
        are application-level Internet protocols that use the Internet's transport protocols</p>
